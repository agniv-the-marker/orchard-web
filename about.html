    <h2>what to build?</h2>

    <p>
        our regular sessions include intros, live coworking, and opportunity to demo and discuss your work. Your project can be something

        <ul>
            <li>...you've been wanting to do</li>
            <li>...that scares you, something that you might fail at</li>
            <li>...you feel strongly about, something you love</li>
            <li>...experimental</li>
            <li>...you'd think about in the shower</li>
            <li>...you're good at</li>
            <li>...you want to be great at</li>
        </ul>

        your project can be something you've been wanting to do, something you might fail at, something you loveâ€¦ as long as it makes you feel alive !
