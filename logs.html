    <h1>`logs`</h1>
    <p>here, we plan to document some of the philosophy, culture, and projects that have come out of <span
        class="orchard">[orchard]</span>.</p>

    <p>we're looking for submissions for our logs! submit <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1nTQd-PmpLCW2lqNzQm67gBXHX-H80XgPKNAYl9NNQPXNKg/viewform?usp=dialog">your rambles here.</a></p>

    <p>
      we hope that these logs can serve as a record of the community and the work that we do, and invite musings to be
      added here over time.
    </p>

    <h3>[first log]</h3>

    <p style="color: rgb(111, 111, 111); font-style: italic;">Feb 4th, 2024 <span style="float: right;"><a href="https://agniv.me/">agniv sarkar</a></span></p>

    <p>This log is a little overdue.</p>

    <p>It's the first real log, and so I'll keep it short. The art room has guitars now (and people willing to play them!) which makes it even homier.</p>

    <p>Hosts are on rotation now so it feels a lot more chill. It's a 'mega-moment,' where it's really become self-actualizing. There are more hosts now and more participants. (It's a really weird problem to have where we don't actually have enough chairs in all the rooms). We're all transitioning to becoming hosts of the space.</p>

    <p>At the end of sessions, we've transitioned from asking everyone to tell us an update, because there are so many people (and the last thing we want is for mostly university students to go to bed late on a weeknight), and instead having people offer themselves. There were some really chill ones, like a dnd character, research on aids program, website development, multiple lino prints, and physics notes.</p>

    <p>This is nighttime. The lights are dim and there is soft guitar playing. On the walk back home it feels light (there are stars out) and we talk about it.</p>

    <p>Soon it is daytime.</p>

    <p>I headed there early because, well, I always love a cafe (specifically Common Ground!) in the morning. We run into the same problem (so many people!). My glasses always fog up from the humidity of people working and laughing so I have to place them on my head and squint. I get the barista's special (a mix of EVERYTHING, hot chocolate, chai, and espresso all in one) and head to the table with the sign "[orchard] reserved."</p>

    <p>A family came up and they sat for a few minutes (I came really early) while I figured stuff out. Then the people start rolling in. And they don't stop. There's a digital artist, a story writer, a math reader, a speed artist, an anatomy artist, multiple poets, and many a beverage enjoyer.</p>

    <p>We're really lucky to have <i>spaces</i>. I'm not an analytic philosopher here, so I won't bog down with details. There's color here, there's people here, there's laughter and grace and freedom and peace.</p>

    <p>It feels good.</p>
