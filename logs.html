    <h1>`logs`</h1>
    <p>here, we plan to document some of the philosophy, culture, and projects that have come out of <span
        class="orchard">[orchard]</span>.</p>

    <p>we're looking for submissions for our logs! submit <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1nTQd-PmpLCW2lqNzQm67gBXHX-H80XgPKNAYl9NNQPXNKg/viewform?usp=dialog">your rambles here.</a></p>

    <p>
      we hope that these logs can serve as a record of the community and the work that we do, and invite musings to be
      added here over time.
    </p>

    <h3>[sample log]</h3>

    <p style="color: rgb(111, 111, 111); font-style: italic;">Jan 4th, 2024 <span style="float: right;"><a href="https://agniv.me/">agniv sarkar</a></span></p>

    <p>lorem ipsum always made me shrug, but i realize now that i don't know where it's from or what it means because i never learned latin. checking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">wikipedia</a> it looks like its some kind of alteration of cicero's philosophy, and he's talking about the pursuit of pain and says "i don't like exercising" lol. 
    </p>
    <p>
      but like, how did it become so popular? it looks like something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letraset">Letraset</a> used it, and they were popular because they were the "cool" printers, the guys who would let you be all punk without breaking the bank. so thats why they're big, but choosing lorem ipsum?
    </p>
    <p>
      from <a href="https://www.straightdope.com/21343427/what-does-the-filler-text-lorem-ipsum-mean">looking online</a>, the only plausible theory right now was it was genuinely random. i'm going to make the educated guess that whoever was doing it didn't necessarily know latin and just randomly picked bits and pieces from cicero that were nonsensical. and that's how we got lorem ipsum.
