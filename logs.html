        here, we plan to document some of the philosophy, culture, and projects
        that have come out of <span class="orchard">[orchard]</span>.

      <h3>planting an [orchard] - autumn/winter 2024</h3>

      <p style="color: rgb(111, 111, 111); font-style: italic">
        May 4th, 2025
        <span style="float: right"
          ><a href="https://malaikaaiyar.me/">malaika aiyar</a></span

      </p>

      <p>
        This idea of passion project collectives started in Waterloo with
        <span style="color: powderblue">Socratica</span>, and in 2022, our
        friend Euan at Cambridge started
        <span style="color: tomato">[scale down]</span>. Later, Xi started
        <span style="color: dodgerblue">[craft]</span> in London, and Grace
        started <span style="color: lightgreen">[orchard]</span> in Oxford which
        ran just for the winter of '23.
      </p>

      <p>
        It reached me in the summer of '24, when Xi hosted a
        <span style="color: pink">Symposium</span>, a showcase of projects from
        these 'nodes' around the UK. The energy of making. Space to fail. People
        sharing things they were truly passionate about. Simply put, I really
        wanted this in Oxford.
      </p>

      <p>
        And lucky for me, Grace was looking for co-hosts: she found me and Lydia
        and we wanted to revive [orchard]. The rest of summer was spent
        exchanging thousands of words on a group chat. So many things to iron
        out, logistics, details, where do you even find these people? Contrary
        to 'Sunday morning coworking', a format popular at other nodes (the term
        for a single project group), we dreamt of a cosy evening gathering:
        people gathered on the floor under warm lamps, ideas flowing freely,
        soft guitar playing in the background, drinking green tea-- this is the
        vision we worked towards initially.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sarah has been supporting [orchard] since the start. She has been my
        printmaking teacher and close friend for the last year and a bit. Sarah
        took a chance on [orchard] by letting us use her art studio every
        Tuesday evening for [orchard]. It's a wonderfully cluttered, inherently
        creative, experimental space. You look up at a painted wooden ceiling,
        which dates to the early 17th century. And as you look around, the walls
        are full with art made by students recently: paintings, posters, prints,
        photographs, text, sculptures. The best part is the teapot: it's
        absolutely massive, and it would become an [orchard] staple, though we
        didn't know this at the beginning.

        The day of the first session came soon. Each of us invited a few friends
        and prayed they would come; I bought a small packet of sencha from the
        Covered Market and a few small snacks from my favourite stores in
        Jericho.
      </p>

      <p>
        And… 16 people came to the first session! Woah… what? The energy was
        incredible: people brought their friends, conversations afterwards went
        until 4am because we were buzzing from drinking way too much
        <span style="color: green">sencha</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grace, Lydia and I also chatted afterwards. We felt so lucky and wanted
        to keep this going. We wondered what it would be like to scale from this
        to having <i>50 attendees</i> weekly… the path there was unclear. And we
        were left with so many things to fix: we needed to buy way more snacks
        (some people thought it was going to be dinner), improve the range of
        projects, not stay up until 4am thinking about things and setting up new
        luma links.
      </p>

      <p>
        The weeks went by very quickly. I think photos tell the story better.

        In December 2024, we came together in London with the other nodes in the
        UK for an event we call [ensemble]. It's like a recurring version of the
        summer Symposium that inspired us at the beginning. People from the
        community share their projects and skills either through demos or by
        leading spontaneous workshops.

        I am writing this in the middle of February 2025. That '50 attendees
        weekly' goal? I think we actually reached it this term. All this is so
        much more than we ever dreamt of when we sat down to think about
        [orchard] in summer. I have a lot of dreams for the next year: more
        [ensemble], collaborative favour auction, workshops, a podcast, new
        types of tea, a third weekly session, music sessions, garden party,
        maybe an Oxford symposium… come to
        <span style="color: lightgreen">[orchard]</span> to find out.

      <h3>[first log]</h3>

      <p style="color: rgb(111, 111, 111); font-style: italic">
        Feb 4th, 2024
        <span style="float: right"
          ><a href="https://agniv.me/">agniv sarkar</a></span

      </p>

      <p>This log is a little overdue.</p>

      <p>
        It's the first real log, and so I'll keep it short. The art room has
        guitars now (and people willing to play them!) which makes it even
        homier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hosts are on rotation now so it feels a lot more chill. It's a
        'mega-moment,' where it's really become self-actualizing. There are more
        hosts now and more participants. (It's a really weird problem to have
        where we don't actually have enough chairs in all the rooms). We're all
        transitioning to becoming hosts of the space.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of sessions, we've transitioned from asking everyone to tell
        us an update, because there are so many people (and the last thing we
        want is for mostly university students to go to bed late on a
        weeknight), and instead having people offer themselves. There were some
        really chill ones, like a dnd character, research on aids program,
        website development, multiple lino prints, and physics notes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is nighttime. The lights are dim and there is soft guitar playing.
        On the walk back home it feels light (there are stars out) and we talk
        about it.
      </p>

      <p>Soon it is daytime.</p>

      <p>
        I headed there early because, well, I always love a cafe (specifically
        Common Ground!) in the morning. We run into the same problem (so many
        people!). My glasses always fog up from the humidity of people working
        and laughing so I have to place them on my head and squint. I get the
        barista's special (a mix of EVERYTHING, hot chocolate, chai, and
        espresso all in one) and head to the table with the sign "[orchard]
        reserved."
      </p>

      <p>
        A family came up and they sat for a few minutes (I came really early)
        while I figured stuff out. Then the people start rolling in. And they
        don't stop. There's a digital artist, a story writer, a math reader, a
        speed artist, an anatomy artist, multiple poets, and many a beverage
        enjoyer.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're really lucky to have <i>spaces</i>. I'm not an analytic
        philosopher here, so I won't bog down with details. There's color here,
        there's people here, there's laughter and grace and freedom and peace.
      </p>

      <p>It feels good.</p>

      <p>

        events!
